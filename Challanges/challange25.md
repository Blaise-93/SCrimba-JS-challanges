 ##  **Night at the Scrimbies**

 

It's time for the Scrimbies, a prestigious award show for podcast hosts.
We need to assemble a list of podcast hosts so we can start handing out awards. 

_Write a function that takes in the podcast data and
returns a flat array of podcast hosts. There are quite a few ways to approach
this, but try solving the problem using reduce()_

_Once you have a flat array of hosts, write a second function to randomly assign each host a prize
from the awards array._

>  Example output: ["🏆 Alex Booker", "⭐ Bob Smith", "💎 Camilla Lambert" ...] 

 
---
```javascript
const awards = ["🏆", "⭐", "💎", "🥇", "👑"];

function getHosts(data){
   
}

function assignAwards(data){
 
}


console.log(getHosts(podcasts));
console.log(assignAwards(podcasts));
```
