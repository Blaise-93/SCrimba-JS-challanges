What is the difference between the 'Virtual' DOM and the 'real' DOM

ANS (from stackoverflow):
The main difference between the DOM and the virtual DOM is that the DOM is the actual representation of a web pageâ€™s structure and content, while the virtual DOM is an abstract, lightweight copy of the real DOM that can be used to optimize and speed up web development and rendering1.

The virtual DOM is faster and more effective than Real DOM as it just focuses on the updated components instead of updating the entire DOM2. In Virtual DOM, there is less wastage of memory compared to Real DOM in which too much wastage of memory occurs3.
