# What is a fragment:?

- a container to hold on diff elements.

- error boundaries are react compt that catch js error anywher in child cmpt tree, and it catch a lot error during constructors, api -> that's the only impt of class based cmpt.

HOC -> high order cmpt, is a function that takes inner cmpt and return a new compt.
Portal -> is a way to render children into dom nodes that exist outside the parent hierrachy.


what are uncontrolled and controlled cmpt:

- In React, controlled and uncontrolled components are two ways of managing the value of input elements. 
- Uncontrolled components handle their own value internally and can be accessed via refs. 
- Controlled components receive their value and update callback via props and use state to handle the value internally.

uncontrolled cmpts are not controlled by react but controlled by the user, and used to manipulate the dom/cmpt.
