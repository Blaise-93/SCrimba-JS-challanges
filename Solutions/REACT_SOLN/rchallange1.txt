ANS:

Virtual DOM 
* can't directly update HTML

* Acts as a copy of the real DOM, which 
can be frequently manipulated and updated without
a page refresh.

* more of a pattern than a specific technolgy

*synced with the real DOM with 'react-dom'
 
 WHILE;
 Real DOM:
 * Directly updates and manipulates HTML

 * creates a new DOM?full repaint if it is updated

 * An object-based representation of a HTML doc + interface
 for manipulating that object.


 The Key is diffing => what VD is that it looks at diff between one state from the next 
 state and update that state in the dom instead of updating everything at a go

 SHadow DOM => is browser-specific technolgy.
